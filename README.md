mu4e-goodies-hacks
------------------

This extension provides hacks to change some default behaviors of mu4e.

1. Allow a mu4e-view buffer detached from mu4e-header so that it will be
   retained in a seperated window or frame. Press `'` under mu4e-view
   mode will detach the current message into a new frame. `"` will
   detach into a window below.
2. Always put attachements to the bottom of mail
3. Quickly add last query to bookmarks by press`K` under header view.
4. Make the highlight of message in header view retained even when
   viewing the message, so we can distinguish which mail is read now.
5. Fontify the signatures
6. Using "\M-d" to quickly delete the whole address in to/cc field no
   matter the positon of the cursor 
7. Remove extra blanklines which is annoying in mails generated by
   Outlook/Exchange
8. Quickly add(`M`)/remove(`M`)/search(`k`) flag to mails
9. Break the cjk string contained in queries into bi-grams so that
    xapian could handle. https://researchmap.jp/?page_id=457
10. Fontify signatures which start with `--` line.
